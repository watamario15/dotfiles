# Bash
Alias for Python, Git, apt, and various features.

# Nano
4 speces for an indent, display tab as 4 spaces, use provided "usual" keybindings, and enable all syntax definitions.

# Vim
Syntax, UTF-8, 4 speces for an indent, display tab as 4 spaces, vim-airline, and automatically add closing tags for HTML/XML.

# Installation
You can install by executing the following commands.

```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/watamario15/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

Executing `./initialze.sh` sets up the Git and installs some essential packages.  Also, you can install CASLII/COMETII by `./initialize.sh caslcomet` and development packages for SHARP Brain by `./initialize.sh brain`.
